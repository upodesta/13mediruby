				<p>Bangladesh offers generous opportunities for investment under its liberalised Industrial Policy and export-oriented, private sector-led growth strategy. All but four sectors (i.e. (1) arms and ammunition and other defence equipment and machinery, (2) forest plantation and mechanised extraction within the bounds of reserved forests, (3) production of nuclear energy, and (4) security printing and mining)  are open for private investment in Bangladesh. The government’s role is that of a facilitator which helps create an enabling environment for expanding private investment, both domestic and foreign. The Board of Investment (BOI), established by the government for accelerating private investment, provides institutional support services to intending investors.</p>

<h3 id="general-facilities-incentives">General facilities/ incentives</h3>

<p><strong>Tax holiday</strong></p>

<p>Tax holiday facilities will be available for 5 or 7 years depending on the location of the industrial enterprise. For industrial enterprises located in Dhaka and Chittagong Divisions ( excluding Hill Tract districts of Chittagong Division) the tax holiday facility is for 5 years while it is 7 years for locations in Khulna, Sylhet, Barisal, and Rajshahi, Divisions and the 3 Chittagong hill districts.
Tax holiday facilities are provided in accordance with existing laws. The period of tax holiday will be calculated from the month of commencement of commercial production. Tax holiday certificate will be issued by NBR ( National Board of Revenue) for the total period within 90 days of submission of application.</p>

<p><strong>Tax exemption</strong></p>

<p>Tax exemptions are allowed in the following cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Tax exemption on royalties, technical know-how fees received by any foreign collaborator, firm, company and expert.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Exemption of income tax up to 3 years for foreign technicians employed in industries specified in the relevant schedule of the income tax ordinance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tax exemption on income of the private sector power generation company for 15 years from the date of commercial production.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tax exemption on capital gains from the transfer of shares of public limited companies listed with a stock exchange.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Accelerated depreciation</strong></p>

<p>Industrial undertakings not enjoying tax holiday will enjoy accelerated depreciation allowance. Such allowance is available at the rate of 100 per cent of the cost of the machinery or plant if the industrial undertaking is set up in the areas falling within the cities of Dhaka, Narayangonj, Chittagong and Khulna and areas within a radius of 10 miles from the municipal limits of those cities. If the industrial undertaking is set up elsewhere in the country, accelerated depreciation is allowed at the rate of 80 per cent in the first year and 20 per cent in the second year.
Concessionary duty on imported capital machinery</p>

<p>Import duty, at the rate of 5% ad valorem, is payable on capital machinery and spares imported for initial installation or BMR/BMRE of the existing industries . The value of spare parts should not, however, exceed 10% of the total C &amp; F value of the machinery. For 100%  export oriented industries, no import duty is charged  in case of capital machinery and spares. However, import duty @ 5% is secured in the form of bank guarantee or an indemnity bond will be returned after installation of the machinery. Value added Tax ( Vat)  is not payable for imported capital machinery and spares.</p>

<p><strong>Foreign Investment</strong></p>

<p>Private investment from overseas sources is welcome in all areas of the economy with the exception of the four reserved sectors (mentioned earlier). Such investments can be made either independently or through venture on mutually beneficial terms and conditions. Foreign investment is, however, especially desired in the following major categories of industries:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Export oriented industries</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Industries in the Export Processing Zones ( EPZs)</p>
