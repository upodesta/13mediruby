In a legal sense, an industrial design constitutes the ornamental or aesthetic aspect of an article or product. An industrial design may consist of three-dimensional features, such as the shape of an article, or two-dimensional features, such as patterns, lines or colour.
In principle, the owner of a registered industrial design or of a design patent has the right to prevent third parties from making, selling or importing articles or product bearing or embodying a design, which is a copy, or substantially a copy, of the protected design, when such acts are undertaken for commercial purposes.
The proprietor of a new or original design shall have the right to apply for registration of the said design under the Patents
and Design Act 1911. While this is also called copyright, it is different from the copyright conferred under the Copyright Act 2000

When a design is registered, the proprietor of the design shall, subject to the provision of the Act,
have exclusive copyright in the design.
